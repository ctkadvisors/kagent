/**
 * Audit event-type string constants.
 *
 * Exported individually so callsites import the symbol they emit
 * (`import { TASK_ADMITTED } from '@kagent/audit-events'`) — typo-proof,
 * grep-able, and gives `tsc` a fixed-string check at the import site
 * instead of relying on the type-checker to catch a stringly-typed
 * `'task.adimtted'` (sic) at the emission site.
 *
 * Every const here MUST have a corresponding member in
 * `AuditEventType` (types.ts) and in `AuditEventData`'s discriminated
 * union. The single source of truth for the wire string is THIS file;
 * the union in types.ts re-uses the literals so a rename surfaces as
 * a TypeScript error at every call site.
 *
 * Maintained order matches the SUBSTRATE-V1.md §4.3 spec — kept stable
 * for table-of-contents readability across documentation + audit
 * dashboards.
