/**
 * Capability bundle JWT schema — the substrate's sealed authority token
 * primitive (per docs/SUBSTRATE-V1.md §3.6).
 *
 * A capability JWT names every right an AgentTask has: which tools it
 * may invoke, which models it may call, which artifacts to read, which
 * Agents to spawn, which workspaces to mount, which egress domains to
 * reach. The operator's capability-issuer mints + signs; admission
 * validates; agent-pod surfaces relevant claims via `get_my_context`.
 *
 * **Composition rule (substrate-enforced, non-negotiable):** spawn
 * produces a child capability ⊆ parent's. The substrate validates this
 * at admission. *No application code can re-grant.*
 *
 * **Why the central elegance bet:** capabilities collapse three
 * currently-separate concerns — `allowedChildAgents`, RBAC, secret
 * hygiene — into one primitive. The audit question "can children spawn
 * arbitrary agents?" has a single substrate answer: only if
 * `cap.claims.spawn` includes the target name.
 *
 * Wire format: a JOSE-format JWS, alg `ES256` (recommended) or `RS256`.
 * The signing key is provisioned per `cap-ca.ts` in the operator —
 * either Helm-mounted from a K8s Secret (file-mount path) or
 * cert-manager-rotated (Issuer path). Both paths are supported.
 *
 * **API stability:** this package is the SHARED INTERFACE the rest of
 * Wave 2 (Supervision + Workflows) imports. Schema additions are
 * SemVer-minor; renaming a claim is a SemVer-major bump. Keep the
 * surface stable.
